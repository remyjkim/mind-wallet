# .AI Directory Documentation Standards

This document defines the structure, organization, and formatting standards for all documentation in the `.ai` directory.

---

## Directory Structure

```
backend_v1/.ai/
├── rules/          # Documentation and development rules (this directory)
├── analyses/       # Code analysis, architectural investigations, research, summaries
├── knowledges/     # Reusable knowledge, patterns, decisions, lessons learned
├── tasks/          # Task planning, implementation plans, specifications
└── skills/         # Reusable skills, techniques, scripts organized by domain
    ├── testing/    # Testing skills and scripts
    ├── performance/ # Performance optimization techniques
    ├── debugging/  # Debugging workflows and tools
    └── ...         # Other skill domains as needed
```

**CRITICAL RULE**: Never create files directly under `.ai/` directory. All files MUST be in subdirectories (rules/, analyses/, knowledges/, tasks/, skills/). The only exception is temporary summary/review documents that will be archived.

---

## 1. RULES Directory (`rules/`)

**Purpose**: Define standards, conventions, and rules for the project.

**Naming Convention**: `NN_topic_name.md`
- `NN`: Two-digit number (01, 02, 03...)
- `topic_name`: Descriptive kebab-case name
- Examples: `01_identity_execution.md`, `02_docs_usage.md`, `03_api_conventions.md`

**Content Structure**:
```markdown
# ABOUTME: Brief description of what this rule covers
# ABOUTME: Second line of description if needed

# [Rule Title]

**Status**: [Active | Draft | Superseded]

```

**Naming Rules**:
- **Plans**: `NN_planN_description.md` where N is the iteration (plan1, plan2, plan3...)
  - Use when exploring options or refining architecture
  - Each plan iteration represents a stage in decision-making
  - Later plans often supersede earlier ones

- **Main Docs**: `NN_description.md` (no type prefix)
  - Final implementation plans, specifications, designs
  - The "active" documents used during implementation
  - Examples: `05_implementation_plan.md`, `05_route_specifications.md`

- **Completions**: `NN_completion_description.md`
  - Created when task is complete
  - Retrospective, summary, lessons learned
  - Example: `04_completion_database_schema.md`

- **Archive**: `NN_archive/`
  - MUST create for any task with multiple planning iterations
  - Contains superseded versions and historical documents
  - Keeps main directory clean while preserving history

**Content Guidelines**:
- **Actionable**: Tasks should have clear, executable steps
- **Measurable**: Include concrete acceptance criteria
- **Updated**: Keep status current as work progresses
- **Documented**: Record decisions and changes during implementation
- **Archived**: Move superseded plans to archive subdirectory

---

## General Formatting Standards

### Markdown Conventions

#### Headers
- Use ATX-style headers (`#`, `##`, `###`)
- One H1 per document (the title)
- Logical hierarchy (don't skip levels: H1 → H3)
- Use sentence case for headers

#### Lists
- Use `-` for unordered lists (not `*` or `+`)
- Use `1.` for ordered lists (auto-numbering)
- Indent nested lists with 2 spaces
- Use checkboxes for task lists: `- [ ]` or `- [x]`

#### Code Blocks
````markdown
```typescript
// Always specify language for syntax highlighting
const example = "like this";
```
````

#### Links
- Use descriptive link text: `[See analysis](./analyses/01_auth_system.md)`
- Not: `[click here](./analyses/01_auth_system.md)`
- Use relative paths for internal links
- Verify links aren't broken

#### Tables
```markdown
| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Data 1   | Data 2   | Data 3   |
```
- Align headers with pipe separators
- Keep tables readable in plain text

#### Emphasis
- Use **bold** for important terms, definitions
- Use *italic* for emphasis
- Use `code` for filenames, variables, commands
- Use > blockquotes for callouts or notes

### Document Metadata

Every document should start with:
```markdown
# [Document Title]

**[Relevant metadata fields]**
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Status**: [Current status]

---

[Content begins here]
```

### Status Values

Use consistent status terminology:
- **Planning**: Initial planning phase
- **Draft**: Work in progress
- **In Review**: Ready for review
- **In Progress**: Active implementation
- **Blocked**: Waiting on dependencies
- **Completed**: Finished and verified
- **Cancelled**: No longer pursuing
- **Superseded**: Replaced by newer document
- **Archived**: Historical reference only

### File Organization

#### Keep Related Files Together
```
tasks/
├── 05_implementation_plan.md           # Main plan
├── 05_route_specifications.md          # Related specs
├── 05_service_layer_design.md          # Related design
└── 05_archive/                         # Related archive
    └── plan1_initial_exploration.md
```

#### Use Consistent Numbering
- Pad numbers: `01`, `02`, `10` (not `1`, `2`, `10`)
- Allows proper alphabetical sorting
- Makes space for future insertions

#### Archive Old Versions
- Don't delete superseded documents
- Move to `NN_archive/` subdirectory
- Rename descriptively: `plan1_initial_exploration.md`
- Helps track decision evolution

---

---

## References Frontmatter Field

All documents should list related documents, code, and external resources in the `**References**:` frontmatter field, not inline in the document body.

### Format

```markdown
**References**: [tasks/05_implementation_plan.md, analyses/01_auth_system.md, src/services/auth.ts, https://fastify.io/docs]
```

### What to Include

**Internal Documents**:
- Related tasks, analyses, knowledge docs
- Use relative paths from `.ai/` directory
- Examples: `tasks/05_implementation_plan.md`, `analyses/01_auth_system.md`, `knowledges/postgres_fts.md`

**Code Files**:
- Relevant source files
- Use paths from project root
- Examples: `src/services/auth.ts`, `src/routes/knowledge/items.ts`, `test/integration/auth.test.ts`

**Skills**:
- Applicable skills from skills directory
- Examples: `skills/testing/integration_test_patterns.md`, `skills/performance/query_optimization.md`

**External Resources**:
- Official documentation
- Articles, blog posts
- GitHub repositories, issues, PRs
- Examples: `https://fastify.io/docs`, `https://github.com/org/repo/pull/42`

### Guidelines

- **List format**: Comma-separated list in square brackets
- **No descriptions**: Just paths/URLs, no explanatory text
- **Keep updated**: Add/remove references as doc evolves
- **Be selective**: Only include directly relevant references
- **No duplicates**: Each reference listed once

### Examples

**Task References**:
```markdown
**References**: [analyses/04_schema_complete.md, skills/database/migrations.md, src/db/schema/knowledge.ts]
```

**Analysis References**:
```markdown
**References**: [tasks/02_auth_endpoints.md, src/plugins/auth.ts, https://jwt.io/introduction]
```

**Knowledge References**:
```markdown
**References**: [knowledges/drizzle_patterns.md, https://orm.drizzle.team/docs]
```

**Skill References**:
```markdown
**References**: [skills/testing/integration_patterns.md, test/setup.ts]
```

## Best Practices

### Do:
✅ Use descriptive, searchable titles
✅ Include creation/update dates
✅ List related docs in References frontmatter
✅ Update status as work progresses
✅ Archive superseded documents in NN_archive/
✅ Use consistent naming: planN for iterations, completion for summaries
✅ Create files ONLY in subdirectories, never directly under .ai/
✅ Use consistent formatting
✅ Include examples and code samples
✅ Add ABOUTME comments at file start
✅ Keep documents focused and single-purpose
✅ Use checkboxes for actionable items

### Don't:
❌ Create files directly under .ai/ directory (always use subdirectories)
❌ Delete planning iterations (archive them in NN_archive/)
❌ Create orphaned documents (always add References)
❌ Use vague titles like "notes.md" or "misc.md"
❌ Delete historical documents (archive instead)
❌ Mix multiple topics in one document
❌ Leave status as "Planning" forever
❌ Add inline cross-reference links (use References frontmatter)
❌ Duplicate information across documents
❌ Skip metadata headers
❌ Skip plan iteration numbers (always use plan1, plan2, not just "plan")
❌ Commit without verifying Markdown renders correctly
